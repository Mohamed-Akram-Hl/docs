# Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

* Example:

```
ecrire(10 + 5)
```

Lesko divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators

* Comparison operators

* Logical Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator      | Name           | Example  | Output
--------------|----------------|----------|-------
 `+`          | Addition       | 3 + 4    | 7
 `-`          | Subtraction    | 5 - 1    | 4
 `*`          | Multiplication | 5 * 3    | 15
 `/`          | Division       | 10 / 2   | 5
 `mod` or `%` | Modulus        | 10 mod 3 | 1
 `**`         | Exponentiation | 3 ** 2   | 9
 `div`        | Floor division | 10 div 3 | 3
