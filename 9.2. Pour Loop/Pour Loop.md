# Pour Loop

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the `pour` loop instead of a `tantque` loop

It start by a specified number, and increments by 1, and ends at a specified number using `jusqua` statement.

* Example

The example below will write the numbers 0 to 4:

```
pour i = 0 jusqua 4
{
  ecrire(i)
}
```
